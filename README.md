Formalization of a Two-party Guessing Game in EasyCrypt
=======================================================

This repository contains the formalization in
[EasyCrypt](https://github.com/EasyCrypt/easycrypt) of a two-party
guessing game and the proof of its security in a real/ideal
style. Security is achieved by relying not on cryptographic
mechanisms, but on a shared trusted infrastructure in which immutable
objects are stored in a physical memory, and the two parties have
virtual memories giving them indirect access to certain objects.
